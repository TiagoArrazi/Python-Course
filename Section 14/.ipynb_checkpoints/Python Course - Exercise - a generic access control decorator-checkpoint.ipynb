    "- You may assume smaller access level value would have higher privilege. For example, 0 - admin, 1 - user, 2 - guest.\n",

    "- If the user does not have a proper access level, we raise a `PermissionError` with the message:\n",
    "    'You do not have the proper access level.'\n",
    "- The decorator should be generic, which means it can be applied to any function that has any amount of\n",
    "    arguments (or key word arguments).\n",
